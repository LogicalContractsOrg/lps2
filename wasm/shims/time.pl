/** <module> library(time), for a system with no clock to interrupt it

    `library(time)` is missing from the WebAssembly image because everything
    in it is built on an alarm that fires on another thread, and there is only
    one thread. LPS2 uses one predicate of it — call_with_time_limit/2, which
    lps_http.pl puts around a long operation and lps_api.pl inherits.

    The substitute bounds the goal by *inferences* instead of seconds, with
    call_with_inference_limit/3, and throws the very exception the real one
    throws. So the recovery code above it is entered exactly as it is on the
    server, and a runaway program in a browser tab still stops.

    What is lost, and it should be said plainly: inferences are not seconds.
    A goal that spends its time in one expensive built-in (a large sort, a
    regular expression) makes few inferences and can outlast its budget; a
    goal in a tight recursive loop is stopped early if the machine is faster
    than the flag below says. The flag is what makes that adjustable:

        ?- set_prolog_flag(lps_wasm_inferences_per_second, 8 000 000).

    The default is deliberately generous (a browser tab that stops a legitimate
    30-second proof at 12 seconds is a worse bug than one that takes 45), and
    it is measured, not guessed: see wasm/README.md.
