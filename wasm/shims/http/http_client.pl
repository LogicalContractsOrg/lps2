/** <module> library(http/http_client), the two predicates lps_llm.pl uses

    src/edges/lps_llm.pl posts to an LLM provider with http_post/4 and reads a
    JSON reply. Everything else in that library is a server's business.

    The post goes through http_open/3 above, so it obeys the same rule: the
    browser will not let a page post to another origin unless that origin
    allows it, and no LLM provider does. A deployment that wants "Write it in
    English" to work therefore puts its own proxy in front (wasm/api/proxy.js),
    and lps_wasm_app.pl rewrites the provider's address into the proxy's.
