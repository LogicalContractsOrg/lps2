/** <module> library(http/http_open), over the browser's own fetch

    Four places in LPS2 open an HTTP stream: a model's endpoint
    (lps_llm.pl), the model list (lps_models.pl), an LE2 reached over HTTP
    rather than loaded in process (lps_le.pl), and Sentry (lps_telemetry.pl).
    `library(http/http_open)` is a socket library, and a browser tab has no
    sockets — but it does have a network, reached through the page rather
    than through the operating system.

    So this is not a stub: it really fetches. The request goes out to the
    host's `fetch` (lps_wasm_app.pl → the worker → XMLHttpRequest, synchronously,
    which is allowed in a worker and is what a blocked Prolog wants anyway),
    and the reply comes back as a memory-file stream that reads exactly like
    the socket stream would have.

    Two things behave differently, and both are the browser's rules rather
    than this file's:

      1. **Same-origin, or CORS.** A page may fetch its own origin freely and
         another only with that server's permission. An LLM provider gives no
         such permission, which is the reason the Vercel deployment puts a
         proxy of its own in front of them (wasm/api/proxy.js): the key stays on
         the server, and the request is same-origin. lps_wasm_app.pl rewrites a
         request to a configured provider into a request to that proxy.
      2. **No timeouts on the wire.** `timeout(S)` is passed on to the XHR,
         which honours it in a worker; a browser that does not simply takes as
         long as it takes.
