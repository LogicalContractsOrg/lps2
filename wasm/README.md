# `wasm/` — LPS2 as a static site

This directory builds LPS2 into a directory of files that a static host serves
as it is: no server, no container, no SWI-Prolog at the far end. The engine is
compiled to WebAssembly and runs in the visitor's own tab — the IDE, the
timeline, the 2D scene, the explanations and all.

**The instructions are [`docs/dev/deploy-vercel.md`](../docs/dev/deploy-vercel.md)** —
how to build it, how to deploy it to Vercel, what it can and cannot do, and
how it works. This file is the map of the directory.

```sh
./wasm/build.sh                                # → wasm/dist/
./wasm/build.sh --with-le                      # …and Logical English in the page
node wasm/runtime/serve.mjs wasm/dist 8080     # → http://localhost:8080/
cd wasm/dist && vercel deploy --prod
```

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `build.sh` | the whole build, in eight steps it names as it goes |
| `lps_wasm_app.pl` | the browser transport: a JSON request in, a JSON reply out, over `src/edges/lps_api.pl` — the same operations the server runs |
| `pack.pl` | what goes into the payload (`examples/` is a gigabyte; this is the part of it that is programs) |
| `shims/` | the libraries SWI-Prolog's WebAssembly image does not have, each stood in for; `shims/README.md` is the list. `src/core/` needs none of them |
| `runtime/boot.js` | replaces `window.fetch` before the IDE's own scripts run, so that `/lpsapi` is answered by the worker |
| `runtime/worker.js` | the worker: SWI-Prolog, the payload unpacked into its file system, and the one call |
| `runtime/mkpayload.mjs` | four hundred files into one gzipped payload |
| `runtime/inject.mjs` | the script tags, into the pages that need them |
| `runtime/mkvercel.mjs` | `vercel.json`, and the same routing in English for other hosts |
| `runtime/serve.mjs` | the built site locally, with that routing applied |
| `api/proxy.js` | the Vercel Function that forwards what a page may not fetch itself, with the key kept on the server |
| `dist/` | the build (git-ignored) |

This is not `src/edges/lps_wasm.pl`, which is **Deploy as WASM** in the IDE's
Misc menu: one program and the engine in a single self-contained page (M11).
That was the proof that the engine runs in a browser. This is the IDE built on
top of it.

Nothing here is in the fly.io image, and nothing here changes it: `Dockerfile`,
`fly.toml` and `buildPush.sh` are as they were. The one file both deployments
share is `src/edges/lps_api.pl` — the operations, with no HTTP in them — which
is the point of the whole arrangement.
