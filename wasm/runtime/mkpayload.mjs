/* mkpayload.mjs — the virtual file system, as one file.
 *
 * The browser build needs LPS2's Prolog, the examples and the corpus programs
 * inside the worker's file system before it can answer anything. Four
 * hundred-odd fetches would be four hundred round trips and a cache that never
 * quite holds; one file is one request, gzipped here rather than trusting the
 * host to do it, so it behaves the same on Vercel, on GitHub Pages and on
 * `python3 -m http.server`.
 *
 * The layout is as simple as it can be and still be read in one pass:
 *
 *     "LPSW"                     4 bytes, so a wrong file says so immediately
 *     uint32 little-endian       the length of the manifest
 *     manifest                   JSON: {files: [[path, offset, length], ...]}
 *     blob                       the files, end to end, in manifest order
 *
 * Offsets are into the blob, and a file's bytes are its bytes — no encoding,
 * no escaping — because SWI-Prolog will read them back as the UTF-8 they
 * already are.
 *
 * Usage:  node mkpayload.mjs <file-list> <repo-root> <out.bin>
 * where <file-list> is one repository-relative path per line, as
 * wasm/pack.pl's payload_files/1 prints them.
