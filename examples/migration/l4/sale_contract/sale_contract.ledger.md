A source element is **encoded** when a documented mapping rule translated it with its meaning unchanged, **approximated** when the mapping changes its meaning in a documented way (see the note), and **residue** when it was not translated: it is marked in the program (`% RESIDUE <id> BEGIN ... END`) for the LE Contract Assistant or a person.
