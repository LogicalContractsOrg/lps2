## Summary

| Verdict | Source elements |
|---|---|
| encoded | 9 |
| approximated | 0 |
| residue | 0 |
| **total** | 9 |

Fidelity: 0 source test(s) translated to scenarios; not run.

A source element is **encoded** when a documented mapping rule translated it with its meaning unchanged, **approximated** when the mapping changes its meaning in a documented way (see the note), and **residue** when it was not translated: it is marked in the program (`% RESIDUE <id> BEGIN ... END`) for the LE Contract Assistant or a person.
